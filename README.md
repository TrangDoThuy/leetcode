## 152. Maximum Product Subarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

## 15. 3Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:

Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

## 11. Container With Most Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

### 70. Climbing Stairs
https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45

### 322. Coin Change
https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:


Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11

Output: 3 

Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Example 2:


Input: coins = [2], amount = 3

Output: -1

Note:
 
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

### 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.


Example:


Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

Output: 4 

Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 

Note:


There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
>bisect_left()

This method locates insertion point for a given element in the list to maintain sorted order. If it is already present in the list, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any existing entries. The return value can be used as the first parameter to list.insert()

### 91. Decode Ways
https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26

Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:

Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
Example 2:

Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
