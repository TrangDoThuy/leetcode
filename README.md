## 152. Maximum Product Subarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
